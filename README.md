#  MPL115A2

Freescaleâ€™s MPL115A2 employs a MEMS pressure sensor with an I2C interface to provide accurate Pressure/Altitude and Temperature data.The sensor outputs are digitized by a high resolution 24-bit ADC. It is capable of detecting a change in only 0.05 kPa which equates to a 0.3m change in altitude.
